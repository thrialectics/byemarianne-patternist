**August 8, 2025** This afternoon I was reorganizing my bookshelf, and I noticed something about what I tend to read. I keep being drawn to authors who write about absence. Like, they write what's missing rather than what's there. There's a certain melancholy in everything I choose to read. It's like Susan Sontag's "Saturnine Personality" is the only kind of author/theorist I'm interested in. I think what it is really is that I'm constantly looking for writers who understand that the most important things can't be said directly. Which makes me wonder if I'm building this ARG because I'm drawn to that same kind of indirect revelation, or if I'm just projecting my own tendency to find meaning in everything that's absent rather than present.

**August 9, 2025** So I had a conversation today that made me realize how much I've internalized certain assumptions about how people solve problems. I was explaining the conversational puzzle mechanics for Friday's letter/site challenge to someone, and they asked why I assumed the players would naturally use some psychological insight rather than just brute-force their way through. It's a fair question. I think I'm building for people like me and I hope to attract them. By that I mean who see the patterns and motivations everpresent in everything. They can't help but analyze the emotional subtext of every interaction. That's probably not most people. Maybe I need to design more scaffolding for players who don't instinctively read between the lines. I'm still testing, iterating, figuring out what does and doesn't work.

**August 10, 2025** I finally took a walk around the neighborhood tonight (first time in over a week, sadly) and I found myself cataloging all the small signs of suffering that I'm not sure most people notice. There's a house where the yard is clearly neglected (and not because they're cultivating a local ecosystem...) and the neighbor across the street is smoking cigarettes again after I hadn't seen her out smoking in over a year. The other neighbor, the younger one who fights with her boyfriend all the time, I haven't seen him around in a couple of weeks, which is rare. I read things like this in everything. I think this kind of noticing is exactly what I'm trying to teach people how to see through my work. It's like, that subtle wrongness that indicates something deeper is happening. It's the same skill you need for good investigation: learning to notice what's absent, what doesn't fit, what people are trying *not* to reveal. That the truest truths are visible in everything that's just slightly askew. It's like the Barking Dog, from Sherlock Holmes...

**August 11, 2025** My "potential patron" gave me some feedback today that felt brutal but I think it was necessary. He pointed out that I'm designing for emotional intelligence that a lot of people simply don't have, and that my assumption that players will naturally develop this kind of insight might be naive. He's probably right that there's an element of wishful thinking in everything I'm building, like I'm almost trying to create the kind of people I wish existed rather than designing for the people who actually do? But then again, maybe that's the point? I would like to think that good art always assumes the best version of its audience and then challenges people to meet that assumption. Good management, too, actually. The question is whether I'm being inspirational or just setting everyone up for frustration.

**August 12, 2025** Been thinking about why I'm so drawn to systems that "fail gracefully" rather than systems that never fail at all. There's something beautiful about designing for an elegant degradation. I am  excited by the possibility that things might go wrong in interesting ways, not catastrophic ones. I think there's a parallel to human relationships in everything I'm designing here, the idea that the best connections happen when people can be real and exposed with each other, when there's room for mistakes and misunderstandings that lead to deeper intimacy. It's about creating a space where someone can safely reveal what they're afraid to reveal. The breakdown of our defenses can become moments of connection if we let them.

**August 13, 2025** I read and wrote at the coffee shop today and just watching people interact. I eavesdrop and notice the conversations that feel natural and the ones where one party is clearly performing to be what the other one is looking for. You can see it in their body language and even the cadence of their speech. It's obvious when someone is trying too hard to be charming or intelligent because there's an uncanny forcefulness in everything they do, that's just a little off. They're just a little too much. The genuine interactions are more flowing in some way. It's intuitive to me but harder to explain. Their interpersonal rhythm stays consistent even when the topics shift. It got me thinking about what my project, whether I'm going to come across with that same uncanny forcefulness, too-muchness, or if I can pull off creating a consistent emotional and intellectual experience. I don't want it to seem chaotic or haphazard; there's got to be genuine insight woven into everything rather than just surface-level hypertextual references. So I'm wondering if there's something about authentic design that's like the authentic conversations, where you can sense immediately whether the person really understands what they're talking about or if they're just being...stochastic parrots of depth. 

**August 14, 2025** Okay, I had this odd realization while I was writing tests for the puzzles tonight. There's something to be said for designing failure modes that are more interesting than success modes I think. I've tweeted about this and how it applies to the kinds of games I want to design. I live for the moments where the intended experience falls apart but actually reveals something more interesting in the process. Is it possible to design with uncertainty built into everything, where even I don't know exactly how it will unfold? I mean, I think that's what I've been doing so far...not that I don't have a plan. I have the destination and an idea of the path anyway. It's the specifics that get filled in along the way. The moments of "failure" need to become side paths to experiences I that I just couldn't have designed intentionally.
